This repository is where I learn and experiment about different topics:
 
 - Algorithms ( famous/popular, search, sort...)
 - Data structures
 - Design patterns  
 - Problem solving patterns
 - SOLID principles


Also, I upload my solutions to different problems from Leetcode and other similar platforms under the **Leetcode** or **Problems** folder.
